# OpenDCC

### Overview

**OpenDCC** is an Apache 2.0 licensed, open-source Digital Content Creation (DCC) application framework for building modular, production-grade 3D tools. It combines a flexible, plugin-driven architecture with an industry-standard Qt-based interface, embedded Python scripting, [OpenUSD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD) and Hydra integration.

OpenDCC is built for pipeline developers, technical artists, and studios who need custom tools that fit their workflow‚Äînot the other way around.

üõ†Ô∏è This project is a work in progress and is actively developed.

### üé® Industry-Standard Artist Frontend, Developer-Controlled Backend

OpenDCC is built around a core idea:

> **Provide an artist-friendly, industry-standard frontend that feels like home‚Äîwhile giving developers full control over the backend.**

Artists interact with a familiar UI environment‚Äîfor example, viewport manipulators‚Äîwhile developers can swap or extend the underlying scene system, computation logic, or renderer. This separation ensures artists can focus on creativity while technical teams retain complete control over data and integration.

### üí° Pursuing an Industry-Standard UI

OpenDCC aims to deliver a user experience that feels familiar to artists across the industry. By using Qt, PySide, and [Advanced Docking System (ADS)](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System), it provides a clean, industry-standard interface that reflects the interaction paradigms professionals already know‚Äîmulti-pane layouts and scriptable panels. Our goal is to offer the stability and predictability artists expect, while remaining fully customizable underneath.

### üîå Powered by [OpenUSD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD) and Hydra

OpenDCC integrates Pixar's [OpenUSD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD) and Hydra as its primary scene and rendering backends. This provides powerful native support for real-time stage manipulation, variant sets, layering, point instancing, and Hydra-based selection. Hydra allows interactive rendering via multiple render delegates, and is fully compatible with complex production scenes. These technologies are tightly integrated into OpenDCC and serve as the core, non-optional foundations of the current OpenDCC architecture.

As part of our philosophy, we aim to minimize patches or modifications to OpenUSD itself. This ensures that studios can easily swap in their own forks of the USD library with minimal integration overhead, supporting long-term maintainability and compatibility across pipeline environments.

### ‚úÖ Conforms to VFX Reference Platform

OpenDCC conforms to the [VFX Reference Platform](https://vfxplatform.com/), ensuring compatibility with standard production tools, libraries, and Python versions widely used in the visual effects and animation industry.
